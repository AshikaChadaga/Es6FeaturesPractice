const quote = `MARVEL QUOTES    
That’s my secret, Captain. I’m always angry.
I love you 3000.
Cause if we can’t protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we’ll avenge it.
If we’re going to win this fight, some of us might have to lose it.
I can do this all day.
You get hurt, hurt ’em back. You get killed… walk it off.
Whatever it takes.
The city is flying and we’re fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense.
I still believe in heroes.
Avengers, assemble!`;
